This Repo is for RBB MOD for Wargame Red Dragon

content in each file:

  RBB.py
    Contains core utility functions for patch generation.
    
  RBB_Gen.py
    A wrapper script for generation of a series of XML patches.
    
  RBB_General_Excel_Patch.py
    Contains all functions that help patch generation from an excel file that contains game data.

  WGPatcher is required to run the generated XML patch.
  
  Power Crystal is the author of WGPatcher. I won't know if one will ever see Power Crystal again since the Eugen forum has been permanently shutdown months ago, but if Power Crystal ever see this, I would like to let you know that your work is awesome!
